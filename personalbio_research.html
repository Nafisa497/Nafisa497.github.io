            <h1 class="n-sub-title">AIR QUALITY MONITORING</h1>
            <p>Air pollution in major cities of Bangladesh has become quite acute in recent years. Road and building construction activities, mushrooming of brick kilns, increased traffic and resulting vehicular emissions, and ongoing infrastructure megaprojects are responsible for exacerbating the air quality in the urban areas of Bangladesh. As for Bangladesh, studies investigating the relationship between meteorology and air quality parameters mostly focused on Dhaka city. The impact of meteorological factors (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity) on air quality parameters (PM2.5 and PM10) has not been investigated in other mega-cities of Bangladesh considering the time-dependent non-linear relationship between meteorology and PM. Thus, the spatial and temporal variability of PM in Bangladesh and its interaction with meteorology is still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to accomplish three objectives: (a) present spatio-temporal variability of PM pollution in Bangladesh, (b) assess the seasonality in meteorological influences on PM, and (c) compare the meteorological influences on PM among 5 major urban cities of Bangladesh.</p>

            <h1 class="n-sub-title">CROWD MANAGEMENT IN HAJJ</h1>
            <p>Crowd management during Hajj pilgrimage at Mecca in Saudi Arabia represents the most challenging problem of its kind. Massive crowds, heavy concentration, significant foreign presence, stress on rescue personnel and planners all contribute to complex challenges. In this project, approach is being taken to design a crowd mobility management system to assist related bodies in Saudi Arabia to enhance pilgrim safety. Specific project tasks are to design a crowd simulator platform to realistically simulate and manage massive scale crowds exclusively for Hajj scenarios, as well as evaluate project outcomes with real crowds.

            <h1 class="n-sub-title">MINAMATA INITIAL ASSESSMENT (MIA)</h1>
            <p>Mercury is a naturally occurring element which is highly toxic and considered as a major contaminant to the environment. Considering the risks mercury poses to human health, environment and ecological life, an intergovernmental negotiation took place in 2009 to establish a legally binding treaty with the aim of controlling global mercury emission. The treaty named as Minamata Convention was signed in 2013 in which Bangladesh is a signatory. In order to prepare countries for treaty ratification and implementation, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has designed a series of pre-ratification activities named as Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA). To implement this MIA project, financial and technical support is provided by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), respectively. With the help of these authorities and infrastructural support provided by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF), Bangladesh, an approach was taken to develop a national mercury emission profile for Bangladesh. The objective of the paper is to develop a national mercury profile through estimation of mercury releases into all possible pathways (air, water, land, by products and impurities, general waste, sector specific waste treatment/ disposal) in order to assist in management and control of mercury in Bangladesh.

            <p>Detecting count of human beings accurately in a closed indoor environment is crucial in diverse application areas including search and rescue, surveillance, customer analytics, abnormal event detection, human gait characterization, congestion analysis, and many more. Moreover, it has significant importance in preventing any intrusion in a secured indoor space such as a bank vault. Sensor-based technologies (for example camera, Passive Infrared sensor (PIR), etc.) are becoming more popular day by day to ensure enhanced security in such closed indoor setting. However, sensors used in these technologies have to be deployed in visible places. Thus, there exist possibilities of damaging the sensors by intruders. In this study, a novel methodology was proposed to detect human count in such closed indoor setting, which can be deployed in any hidden place being oblivious to intruders. Here, human counting was performed based on different environmental gaseous parameters (Carbon Dioxide, Liquefied Petroleum Gas or LPG, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulfur Dioxide) and two weather parameters (temperature and humidity). </p>
